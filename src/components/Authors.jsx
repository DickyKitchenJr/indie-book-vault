    bio: [
      `A soggy native of Washington State, Stephen Mills escaped as soon as he came to his senses by joining the US Navy. Many adventures ensued, some of which Stephen remembers fondly, and after tricking an amazing woman into marrying him he left the Naval Service. An undiagnosed yet temporary bout of mild insanity ensued in which Stephen convinced his wife to move back home to Washington. Realizing their mistake, they then found themselves in the small burg of Monument, Colorado...unfortunately Colorado is cold and snowy, so after braving the Rocky Mountains for almost a decade, they decided to enjoy the hellish heat of Phoenix before finally settling near Nashville, Tennessee.`,
      `Stephen's most enjoyable hobbies are also those that are decidedly antisocial, such as hiking and fishing. It is difficult to put a finger on why he decided to begin writing books but it probably has something to do with sharing his nightmares with others.`,
      `Thankfully, being an author isn't a team sport, so now you can enjoy his unique brand of dark humor and gory adventure in every book.`,

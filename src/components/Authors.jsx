      `A soggy native of Washington State, Stephen Mills escaped as soon as he came to his senses by joining the US Navy. Many adventures ensued, some of which Stephen remembers fondly, and after tricking an amazing woman into marrying him he left the Naval Service. An undiagnosed yet temporary bout of mild insanity ensued in which Stephen convinced his wife to move back home to Washington. Realizing their mistake, they then found themselves in the small burg of Monument, Colorado...unfortunately Colorado is cold and snowy, so after braving the Rocky Mountains for almost a decade, they decided to enjoy the hellish heat of Phoenix before finally settling near Nashville, Tennessee.`,
      `Stephen's most enjoyable hobbies are also those that are decidedly antisocial, such as hiking and fishing. It is difficult to put a finger on why he decided to begin writing books but it probably has something to do with sharing his nightmares with others.`,

      `Having dabbled in other ‘interests’ over the years (I won’t bore you), in the background, however, I was always an avid reader, with words constantly floating around in my mind yet doing nothing about them—in a literary sense. I used to always say, ‘One day, I’ll write that book!’ But never seemed to get around to doing it. I think the mere thought of putting those words—along with my imagination—to literary use, was daunting, therefore, I was always putting it off. That is, until 2011 when I finally took the plunge and picked up that pen and notebook (still have them, too!). I began to string those words into sentences, then paragraphs, then pages, eventually joining them together to create my first novel—The Sixth Amulet - Book One (released October 2022). Then my imagination had other plans; it didn’t want to stop at just one. Why would it? And so, novel one turned into another, The Moon Chasers - Book Two of The Sixth Amulet - released June 2023) . Who knows where it will end?`,
      `I believe everyone has a story to tell, a potential book tucked away inside them, dying to get out. And all that’s needed to create it is a simple recipe: a pen and a notebook. So, open your mind and let your imagination roam through the endless possibilities it has to offer … then simply write! `,
      `I hope you enjoy reading The Sixth Amulet and The Moon Chasers and promise to have part three of my epic adventure – A Flutter on the Wind - out by Spring 2024. Happy reading!`,

    bio: [
      `I’ve always been a writer. It’s not a choice. It’s a compulsion, and I’ve been writing as long as I can remember. Lots of childish scribbles in notebooks, lots of rejection slips from publishers and agents testify to a craft long in the making. In addition, it has proved necessary to earn a living by other means whilst those vital skills mature. For thirty-eight years I taught Art and Graphic Design, thirty-seven of them in a wonderful independent girls’ school in Birmingham, UK. For much of the latter part of this career I was Head of Department, which gave me the opportunity to place my own stamp on Art education there, sharing with the pupils there my own love of Art and the History of Art. Over a decade I was able to lead annual visits to Florence, Venice and Rome (some of my favourite places on the planet) as destinations on my Renaissance Tour. These visits created memories that I shall cherish for the rest of my life.`,
      `I love history in general, reading history as much as I read fiction. I have a particular interest in the ancient world but I am also fascinated with medieval times and with European history in general. This interest informs my own writing to the extent that human relationships and motivations are a constant throughout the millennia, and there is scarcely a story that could be conceived of that has not already played itself out in some historical context. There is much to learn from observing and understanding such things, much that can be usefully applied to my own work.`,
      `Teaching tends to be a rather time-consuming activity. Since retiring, I have been able to devote much more of my time to writing and has meant that I am finally able to bring my work to the reading public’s attention. I like to think that my ideas are original and that they do not readily fall into existing tropes and categories.
I am not a particularly physical being. I was always terrible at sport and have rather poor physical coordination (as though my body were organised by a committee rather than a single guiding intelligence!). I tend to treat my body as a conveyance for my head, which is where I really dwell. My writing typically derives from dreams. There is a sweet spot between sleeping and waking which is where my ideas originate. I always develop my stories there. When I am writing it feels as though the content of my dreams becomes real through the agency of my fingers on the keyboard. I love the English language, the rich majesty of its vocabulary and its rhythmic possibilities. My arrival at this stage could hardly be describes as precocious. However, at the age of sixty-three, I feel that I have arrived at a place where I can create work of value that others may appreciate and enjoy.`,

      `ABOUT THE AUTHOR`,
      `Khushi T. Saha is a notorious daydreamer. And ask anyone close to her and they’ll tell you she’s a positive, mushy person, too. Enter in ‘writing romance novels’: what began as self-care to overcome personal trauma, ended up evolving into something much more fulfilling. Bringing stories of angst, personal growth, and passion (the steamier the better!) with some snarky humor to romantics all around has become a hunger she can’t seem to satiate. In fact, once she’s done with a story, there’s already another one a-brewin'.`,
      `And because she’s a first-generation Bangladeshi—born and raised in the US—the connection to the motherland is fierce. You’ll find South Asian nuances/representation purposely sprinkled throughout her novels.`,
      `When she's not writing, she's managing her craft business, obsessed with gardening in the spring and summer months, running around with her boys, and binge-watching murder shows/podcasts.`,

Stories about strong, contemporary women who aren’t necessarily looking for romance, but it finds them. Stories that take the reader to different parts of the world. My novels are filled with humor, friendship, romance, and some sexy time too! But one thing you can count on–there is always a happy ending for the heroine!`,

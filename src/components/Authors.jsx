Many adventures ensued, some of which Stephen remembers fondly, and after tricking an amazing woman into marrying him he left the Naval Service. An undiagnosed yet temporary bout of mild insanity ensued in which Stephen convinced his wife to move back home to Washington. Realizing their mistake, they then found themselves in the small burg of Monument, Colorado...unfortunately Colorado is cold and snowy, so after braving the Rocky Mountains for almost a decade, they decided to enjoy the hellish heat of Phoenix before finally settling near Nashville, Tennessee.`,

      `I’ve always been a writer. It’s not a choice. It’s a compulsion, and I’ve been writing as long as I can remember. Lots of childish scribbles in notebooks, lots of rejection slips from publishers and agents testify to a craft long in the making. In addition, it has proved necessary to earn a living by other means whilst those vital skills mature. For thirty-eight years I taught Art and Graphic Design, thirty-seven of them in a wonderful independent girls’ school in Birmingham, UK. For much of the latter part of this career I was Head of Department, which gave me the opportunity to place my own stamp on Art education there, sharing with the pupils there my own love of Art and the History of Art. Over a decade I was able to lead annual visits to Florence, Venice and Rome (some of my favourite places on the planet) as destinations on my Renaissance Tour. These visits created memories that I shall cherish for the rest of my life.`,
      `I love history in general, reading history as much as I read fiction. I have a particular interest in the ancient world but I am also fascinated with medieval times and with European history in general. This interest informs my own writing to the extent that human relationships and motivations are a constant throughout the millennia, and there is scarcely a story that could be conceived of that has not already played itself out in some historical context. There is much to learn from observing and understanding such things, much that can be usefully applied to my own work.`,
      `Teaching tends to be a rather time-consuming activity. Since retiring, I have been able to devote much more of my time to writing and has meant that I am finally able to bring my work to the reading public’s attention. I like to think that my ideas are original and that they do not readily fall into existing tropes and categories.
I am not a particularly physical being. I was always terrible at sport and have rather poor physical coordination (as though my body were organised by a committee rather than a single guiding intelligence!). I tend to treat my body as a conveyance for my head, which is where I really dwell. My writing typically derives from dreams. There is a sweet spot between sleeping and waking which is where my ideas originate. I always develop my stories there. When I am writing it feels as though the content of my dreams becomes real through the agency of my fingers on the keyboard. I love the English language, the rich majesty of its vocabulary and its rhythmic possibilities. My arrival at this stage could hardly be describes as precocious. However, at the age of sixty-three, I feel that I have arrived at a place where I can create work of value that others may appreciate and enjoy.`,

      `Khushi T. Saha is a notorious daydreamer. And ask anyone close to her and they’ll tell you she’s a positive, mushy person, too. Enter in ‘writing romance novels’: what began as self-care to overcome personal trauma, ended up evolving into something much more fulfilling. Bringing stories of angst, personal growth, and passion (the steamier the better!) with some snarky humor to romantics all around has become a hunger she can’t seem to satiate. In fact, once she’s done with a story, there’s already another one a-brewin'.`,
      `And because she’s a first-generation Bangladeshi—born and raised in the US—the connection to the motherland is fierce. You’ll find South Asian nuances/representation purposely sprinkled throughout her novels.`,
      `When she's not writing, she's managing her craft business, obsessed with gardening in the spring and summer months, running around with her boys, and binge-watching murder shows/podcasts.`,

    bio: [
      `I was born and grew up in North London, England, but was unable to attend university when young due to family financial circumstances. Instead, I worked at various occupations, including dental nurse, laboratory assistant and shop assistant.`,
      `I married just before I was 20, and travelled to some interesting places around the world, following my husband’s career. I spent much time reading, a passion, but in order to keep further occupied I took office jobs when these were available to me; I hated the work, but the money was useful.`,
      `When we were back in the UK I took evening classes at various times and gained ‘A’ levels in Psychology, Sociology and English, eventually settling in Kent with my husband and becoming a mature student and gaining Bachelor's and Master's degrees in English and Literature before training and working as a teacher.`,
      `In 2016 we moved to the peace and quiet of rural Lincolnshire, and my sporadic writing activities became more permanent. I self-published Fairytales Don't Come True, my debut novel, in May 2020 and since then have written and published four books of poetry, October Poems, Thanksgiving Poems & Prose Pieces, Poet-Pourri and Social Climbing and Other Poems.`,
      `In January 2021 I published a sequel to Fairytales entitled Degenerate, Regenerate, and at the end of March 2021 I published a psychological suspense story, You Know What You Did. A third book was published in June 2021, entitled All That We Are Heir To, to make up the 'Criminal Conversation' trilogy with Fairytales and Degenerate, In November 2022 I published another psychological suspense story, What Else Did You Do?, which is a sequel to You Know What You Did. The work didn't stop, as alongside this sequel I was writing a fourth book to follow the 'Criminal Conversation' trilogy. Entitled 'Innocent, Guilty'. It was published in January 2023, and a fifth book, 'The Future of Our House' came out in June 2023. The sixth and final book in the series is my current work in progress. I try to go for a long walk each day (weather permitting; I’m a fair-weather walker) in the beautiful countryside around us, and exercise for a couple of hours each morning, including use of a hula-hoop and stepping machine. I love food and drink and have spent half my life battling a weight problem. I managed to lose 5 stone of unfortunately-gained weight a few years ago and am determined to never regain it, Unfortunately however Covid and lockdown thwarted those plans, but at least I haven't put it all back on. Hopefully in 2023 I will manage to lose the excess. Life's certainly not fair in that respect, as every other day is a diet day (for hubby too) but the weight still came back. When not being careful--more often than is desirable these days--we enjoy a good meal with wine.`,
      `For other leisure activities I have taught myself to play the recorder--badly, but it keeps the brain cells ticking over. I also listen to music of many types; Tracy Chapman is playing while I write this, and will later be replaced by Leonard Cohen or Katie Melua or any one of dozens of other artists, or by some classical music or opera, another passion.`,
      `And of course there’s reading, something which I have loved since I was a child. I became a convert to eBooks and subscribed to the Kindle Unlimited programme, because although I love physical books, my bookcases are groaning under the weight and I don’t have room for any more. I review everything I read, since I became an author myself and realise the value of these in getting our work in front of as many eyes as possible; but it does mean that I have a large virtual To Be Read pile!`,
      `In late 2021 I undertook some editorial training and freelance work as a sub-editor. I terminated that work in late 2022, but have my hands full with writing my own books and reviewing those of others. Life is busy and certainly not boring.`,

She is considered a medical mystery and has several rare autoimmune disorders. These disorders caused her to withdraw from Physician Assistant School, but she is happy to be pursuing her dreams of designing, creating, and writing. She thanks God for leading her heart on this new path and recites “perhaps this is the moment for which you were created” in times of doubt (Esther 4:14).`,

      "Whitney Cubbison is a dual American & French citizen living in Paris since 2009. She grew up in Texas and California and graduated from UCLA with a degree in French. She started her career in Communications working for high-tech PR agencies in San Francisco and eventually joined Microsoft where she worked for sixteen years, thirteen of which from the Paris office. During that time, she held various international roles that encompassed public relations, employee communications, executive speechwriting, and social media.",
      "She earned her French citizenship in early 2022 and left Microsoft in the summer of that year to focus on completing her first novel, Will There Be Wine? The story, while fiction, is deeply inspired by Whitney’s own experiences as an ex-pat divorcée living in Paris and trying to navigate the cultural minefield of dating in a foreign country. It was released on January 16, 2023.",
      "When she’s not writing, Whitney can be found sitting in Parisian cafés and restaurants with her friends, drinking wine.",

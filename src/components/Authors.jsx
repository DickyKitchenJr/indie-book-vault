      `A soggy native of Washington State, Stephen Mills escaped as soon as he came to his senses by joining the US Navy. Many adventures ensued, some of which Stephen remembers fondly, and after tricking an amazing woman into marrying him he left the Naval Service. An undiagnosed yet temporary bout of mild insanity ensued in which Stephen convinced his wife to move back home to Washington. Realizing their mistake, they then found themselves in the small burg of Monument, Colorado...unfortunately Colorado is cold and snowy, so after braving the Rocky Mountains for almost a decade, they decided to enjoy the hellish heat of Phoenix before finally settling near Nashville, Tennessee.`,
      `Stephen's most enjoyable hobbies are also those that are decidedly antisocial, such as hiking and fishing. It is difficult to put a finger on why he decided to begin writing books but it probably has something to do with sharing his nightmares with others.`,

      `Having dabbled in other ‘interests’ over the years (I won’t bore you), in the background, however, I was always an avid reader, with words constantly floating around in my mind yet doing nothing about them—in a literary sense. I used to always say, ‘One day, I’ll write that book!’ But never seemed to get around to doing it. I think the mere thought of putting those words—along with my imagination—to literary use, was daunting, therefore, I was always putting it off. That is, until 2011 when I finally took the plunge and picked up that pen and notebook (still have them, too!). I began to string those words into sentences, then paragraphs, then pages, eventually joining them together to create my first novel—The Sixth Amulet - Book One (released October 2022). Then my imagination had other plans; it didn’t want to stop at just one. Why would it? And so, novel one turned into another, The Moon Chasers - Book Two of The Sixth Amulet - released June 2023) . Who knows where it will end?`,
      `I believe everyone has a story to tell, a potential book tucked away inside them, dying to get out. And all that’s needed to create it is a simple recipe: a pen and a notebook. So, open your mind and let your imagination roam through the endless possibilities it has to offer … then simply write! `,
      `I hope you enjoy reading The Sixth Amulet and The Moon Chasers and promise to have part three of my epic adventure – A Flutter on the Wind - out by Spring 2024. Happy reading!`,

      `I’ve always been a writer. It’s not a choice. It’s a compulsion, and I’ve been writing as long as I can remember. Lots of childish scribbles in notebooks, lots of rejection slips from publishers and agents testify to a craft long in the making. In addition, it has proved necessary to earn a living by other means whilst those vital skills mature. For thirty-eight years I taught Art and Graphic Design, thirty-seven of them in a wonderful independent girls’ school in Birmingham, UK. For much of the latter part of this career I was Head of Department, which gave me the opportunity to place my own stamp on Art education there, sharing with the pupils there my own love of Art and the History of Art. Over a decade I was able to lead annual visits to Florence, Venice and Rome (some of my favourite places on the planet) as destinations on my Renaissance Tour. These visits created memories that I shall cherish for the rest of my life.`,
      `I love history in general, reading history as much as I read fiction. I have a particular interest in the ancient world but I am also fascinated with medieval times and with European history in general. This interest informs my own writing to the extent that human relationships and motivations are a constant throughout the millennia, and there is scarcely a story that could be conceived of that has not already played itself out in some historical context. There is much to learn from observing and understanding such things, much that can be usefully applied to my own work.`,
      `Teaching tends to be a rather time-consuming activity. Since retiring, I have been able to devote much more of my time to writing and has meant that I am finally able to bring my work to the reading public’s attention. I like to think that my ideas are original and that they do not readily fall into existing tropes and categories.
I am not a particularly physical being. I was always terrible at sport and have rather poor physical coordination (as though my body were organised by a committee rather than a single guiding intelligence!). I tend to treat my body as a conveyance for my head, which is where I really dwell. My writing typically derives from dreams. There is a sweet spot between sleeping and waking which is where my ideas originate. I always develop my stories there. When I am writing it feels as though the content of my dreams becomes real through the agency of my fingers on the keyboard. I love the English language, the rich majesty of its vocabulary and its rhythmic possibilities. My arrival at this stage could hardly be describes as precocious. However, at the age of sixty-three, I feel that I have arrived at a place where I can create work of value that others may appreciate and enjoy.`,

Enter in ‘writing romance novels’: what began as self-care to overcome personal trauma, ended up evolving into something much more fulfilling. Bringing stories of angst, personal growth, and passion (the steamier the better!) with some snarky humor to romantics all around has become a hunger she can’t seem to satiate. In fact, once she’s done with a story, there’s already another one a-brewin'.`,

      `In 2016 we moved to the peace and quiet of rural Lincolnshire, and my sporadic writing activities became more permanent. I self-published Fairytales Don't Come True, my debut novel, in May 2020 and since then have written and published four books of poetry, October Poems, Thanksgiving Poems & Prose Pieces, Poet-Pourri and Social Climbing and Other Poems.`,
      `In January 2021 I published a sequel to Fairytales entitled Degenerate, Regenerate, and at the end of March 2021 I published a psychological suspense story, You Know What You Did. A third book was published in June 2021, entitled All That We Are Heir To, to make up the 'Criminal Conversation' trilogy with Fairytales and Degenerate, In November 2022 I published another psychological suspense story, What Else Did You Do?, which is a sequel to You Know What You Did. The work didn't stop, as alongside this sequel I was writing a fourth book to follow the 'Criminal Conversation' trilogy. Entitled 'Innocent, Guilty'. It was published in January 2023, and a fifth book, 'The Future of Our House' came out in June 2023. The sixth and final book in the series is my current work in progress. I try to go for a long walk each day (weather permitting; I’m a fair-weather walker) in the beautiful countryside around us, and exercise for a couple of hours each morning, including use of a hula-hoop and stepping machine. I love food and drink and have spent half my life battling a weight problem. I managed to lose 5 stone of unfortunately-gained weight a few years ago and am determined to never regain it, Unfortunately however Covid and lockdown thwarted those plans, but at least I haven't put it all back on. Hopefully in 2023 I will manage to lose the excess. Life's certainly not fair in that respect, as every other day is a diet day (for hubby too) but the weight still came back. When not being careful--more often than is desirable these days--we enjoy a good meal with wine.`,
      `For other leisure activities I have taught myself to play the recorder--badly, but it keeps the brain cells ticking over. I also listen to music of many types; Tracy Chapman is playing while I write this, and will later be replaced by Leonard Cohen or Katie Melua or any one of dozens of other artists, or by some classical music or opera, another passion.`,
      `And of course there’s reading, something which I have loved since I was a child. I became a convert to eBooks and subscribed to the Kindle Unlimited programme, because although I love physical books, my bookcases are groaning under the weight and I don’t have room for any more. I review everything I read, since I became an author myself and realise the value of these in getting our work in front of as many eyes as possible; but it does mean that I have a large virtual To Be Read pile!`,
      `In late 2021 I undertook some editorial training and freelance work as a sub-editor. I terminated that work in late 2022, but have my hands full with writing my own books and reviewing those of others. Life is busy and certainly not boring.`,

But as I read those books with gritted teeth, I always wondered what would happen if someone didn't like fairies, what they would do about it, and could anybody stop them? This idea grew, and the Cracklocks were born.  I liked the idea of people who hated the Fae and everything they stood for.  And that world just keeps on growing.`,
